/src/idl
========

All the C++ source files in this directory are generated by
[webidl-tools](https://github.com/markandrus/webidl-tools) from the
[Web IDL](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL) definitions in `/idl`. Writing these
classes by hand would be quite tedious!

Want to generate these classes yourself? Just run the following:

```
npm run generate-code-from-webidl
```

_Note: The generated sources should not be checked in, per the `.gitignore`
rules._

Converting to and from V8
-------------------------

`Convert<T, F>` defines a partial isomorphism between values of type `T` and
values of type `F`. For any value of type `T`, you can always get back a value
of type `F`.

```cpp
F f = Convert<T, F>::To(T t);
```

For a value of type `F`, you _might_ be able to get a value of type `T`. This
potential for failure is represented by `Either<std::string, T>`, i.e. you will
_either_ receive a value of type `T` _or_ an error string.

```cpp
Either<std::string, F> = Convert<T, F>::From(F f);
```

Each of the generated classes in this directory defines such partial
ismorphisms with `v8::Local<v8::Value>`, making it easy to convert to and from
V8.

/src/idl/webrtc
---------------

Any partial isomorphisms between the generated classes in this directory or
`v8::Local<v8::Value>` are defined in `/src/idl/webrtc`.
